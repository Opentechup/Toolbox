# RestApi Springboot drink microservice example

This is a WebMVC springboot restApi microservice example, part of a supply chain project. 

- Added Lombok : val, var, @RequiredArgsConstructor (project lombok creates constructor for required properties), @Slf4j
- Added MapStruct: plugin to reconciale lombok and mapstruct, and to auto add the spring component annotation by mapstruct when the mapper implementation is generated.
